# PostreSQL instance with multiple databases

We setup a simple PostgreSQL database instance.
Inside, we also create multiple databases.

This is helpful for self-hosted projects, as there won't need to setup multiple databases in a single compose. Instead, setup a single instance and the databases will be created in it.
